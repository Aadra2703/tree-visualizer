# 🌳 Tree Visualizer

> 🚀 A dynamic and interactive web app to visualize tree data structures and explore a variety of tree traversal algorithms — built for students, educators, and curious developers!

---

## 🖼️ Overview

**Tree Visualizer** is a responsive, side-by-side visual learning tool that brings tree traversal algorithms to life. With just a few clicks, you can:
- Insert or delete nodes
- Run multiple tree traversal algorithms
- Watch the algorithm animate through each node step-by-step

This project is a perfect blend of **data structures** and **front-end magic** ✨.

### 🌿 Traversal Algorithms Supported

| Algorithm        | Description                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 🔁 **BFS**         | Breadth-First Search (Level Order)      |
| 🌿 **DFS**         | Depth-First Search                     |
| ↩️ **Inorder**      | Left ➡ Root ➡ Right                     |
| 🔼 **Preorder**     | Root ➡ Left ➡ Right                     |
| 🔽 **Postorder**    | Left ➡ Right ➡ Root                     |
| 🏗️ **Level Order**  | Top-down, layer-by-layer traversal      |
| 🧭 **Vertical Order**| Columns from left to right             |
| 🪄 **Zigzag Order**  | Alternating direction at each level     |
| 🌳 **Boundary Order**| Nodes along the outer boundary of tree |

> Each algorithm animates through the tree, highlighting visited nodes in real time.
